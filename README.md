From Q2 2024 to Q3 2024 Instacart's overall orders increased by 333,587. This 1.75% increase in orders can in part be attributed to large order increases in the "Produce" and "Frozen" departments. Not all departments saw increases during the quarter, with "Dairy Eggs" and "Babies" seeing significant decreases. Organic products saw large decreases in orders while Non-Organic products saw overall increases.
